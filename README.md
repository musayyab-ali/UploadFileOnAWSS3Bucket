# Uploading Files to AWS S3 Bucket
Uploading a file to an AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket. This project typically includes configuring access permissions, generating AWS access keys, and using either the AWS Management Console  or AWS SDKs to upload files.


To upload files to an AWS S3 bucket, ensure the following key points are configured:

1. Set up your AWS access key and secret key.
2. Configure the appropriate AWS region endpoint.
3. Use the AWS SDK for .NET for file upload functionality.
4. Implement a file handling logic to manage the file to be uploaded.
5. Specify the file name, S3 bucket name, and file content type in the upload request.

Ensure that the placeholders "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", "YOUR_SECRET_KEY", and "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME" are replaced with your actual AWS credentials and bucket information.
